# Chiller Plant Technician Suite

This project provides a web-based solution for estimating chiller load in hotels, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency and improving operational performance. By analyzing multiple factors such as hotel occupancy rates, outside weather conditions, day of the week (weekday vs. weekend), and nearby attractions, the system uses Neural Networks to predict the chiller load with high accuracy.

The goal is to adjust the equipmentâ€™s operation dynamically, reducing unnecessary energy consumption by preventing the system from running at full capacity when demand is low. The website interface allows users to input data, view real-time predictions, and monitor trends to ensure efficient energy use throughout the day.

Key Features:
- Neural Network Model: Accurately predicts chiller load based on multiple environmental and operational factors.
- Input Factors: Hotel occupancy, weather conditions, weekdays vs. weekends, and proximity to attractions.
- Real-Time Monitoring: Dashboard for tracking real-time predictions and historical data.
- Energy Efficiency: Optimizes chiller system performance by adjusting output according to demand, minimizing energy wastage.
- Web Implementation: User-friendly website interface for easy input, prediction visualization, and trend analysis.

This solution helps hotels run their chiller systems more efficiently, reducing costs and enhancing overall sustainability by avoiding unnecessary power consumption.
